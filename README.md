# AnantaByte Website — React (Vite) Port

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies
   - npm install
2. Run dev server
   - npm run dev
3. Build for production
   - npm run build

Notes:
- Place your images (logo, favicons) in `public/image/`. They are referenced as `/image/<name>` in the code.
- CSS is copied to `src/assets/style.css` and imported in `src/main.jsx`.
- Routes:
  - `/` Home
  - `/privacy` Privacy Policy
  - `/terms` Terms of Service
  - `/saas` SaaS page

If you'd like TypeScript or additional tweaks (components split further, SEO head per page, analytics setup), tell me and I can add them.
